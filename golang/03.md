# Let's Go!

Let's do a single Hello World application

You only need a single file!
```bash
touch main.go
```

Bare minimum inside the file:
```go [1|2-5]
package main
 
func main() {
    // ...
}
```

To print something, you need the `fmt` package:
```go
import "fmt"
```

So, our Hello World:
```go [1|3-5|7-9]
package main
 
import (
    "fmt"
)
 
func main() {
    fmt.Println("Hello World")
}
```

To run the application, simply do:
```bash
go run main.go
```

We can also create a _single_ binary from our app:
```bash
go build -o hello
```

Even better, assuming you have your `PATH` set up,<br>
you can "install" it globally:
```bash
go install
```

And then, you can simply do:
```bash
hello
 
# Hello World
```
