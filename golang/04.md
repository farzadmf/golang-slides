# Let's Go further!

With some basics out of the way, let's look at some concepts

# Packages

Normally, you would have package names reflecting your folder structure

```
.
├── main.go            ->  package main
└── pkg
    ├── pkg.go         ->  package pkg
    └── subpkg
        └── subpkg.go  ->  package subpkg
```

# Scopes

Go has super simple scopes:
- `package` private
- Global

# Dependency Management

No central repository system

GitHub is the repository!
