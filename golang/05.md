# How to create a Go application

Go has a SUPER powerful CLI

- Create
- Build
- Test
- Profile
- ...

To see information about your environment:
```bash
go env
```
Mostly displays environment variables used for Go

To see a specific value:
```bash
go env GOPATH
```

There are other variables, some of the more important ones:
```
GOPATH
GOMODCACHE
GOROOT
```

Another important path is where "global" binaries are stored<br>

It's `$GOPATH/bin` (we add this to `PATH` manually)

Prior to Go 1.11, all the Go source code had to be inside `GOPATH`

Nowadays, almost all Go libraries and applications use ...

# Modules

This allows to place source code files in any directory

You initialize a module by running:
```bash
go mod init [your-app-name]
```

In a "normal" Go application, `[your-app-name]` is a GitHub URL<br>

For example, our Termask tool (ðŸ˜‰), was created like this:
```bash
go mod init github.com/farzadmf/termask
```

Remember that we talked about packages before?

Let's assume that we created our app using the following command:
```bash
go mod init github.com/mzgang/coolapp
```

We had the following folder structure:
```
.
â”œâ”€â”€ main.go            ->  package main
â””â”€â”€ pkg
    â”œâ”€â”€ pkg.go         ->  package pkg
    â””â”€â”€ subpkg
        â””â”€â”€ subpkg.go  ->  package subpkg
```
If we want to "use" something in `main` from `subpkg`,<br>
We would have the following in `main.go`:
```go
import "github.com/mzgang/coolapp/pkg/subpkg"
```
